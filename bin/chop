<<TODO
allow specifying columns like cut
xsv already supports this so it works as-is for csv/tsv
choose is another option https://github.com/theryangeary/choose
biggest issues are
- passing through zeek headers and only including correct fields, when they will be off by one
- indexes don't make sense for json files
TODO
