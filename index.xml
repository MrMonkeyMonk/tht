This is exactly what chop does. You can accomplish the same thing with awk, cut, zeek-cut, jq, etc. but without changing your tool or syntax when your log format changes.
Here&amp;rsquo;s a comparison between the different tools and log types they support.

However, it is flexible enough that it can be used for other purpsoses as well.
filter has several special features. Most of these behaviors can be changed with flags, but by default it:
Searches in the current directory tree for any conn.log files, including compressed files and rotated logs. Searches files in parallel using multiple cores.</description></item><item><title>Conn Summary</title><link>https://ethack.github.io/tht/summarize/conn-summary/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Mar 2021 22:40:55 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://ethack.github.io/tht/summarize/conn-summary/</guid><description>Zeek&amp;rsquo;s conn-summary.log file contains useful information about a network as a whole.
